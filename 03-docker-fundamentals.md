# Docker Introduction
### - What problems we have with Traditional Infrastructure?
        - Needed to perform install/configs on every server/machine and every environment (dev/qa/staging/production)
        - Issues related to libraries and dependecies keep arising and needed to be resolved. Which resulted in Compatibility and Dependency issues.
        - Difficult to track changes across environments and they end-up with inconsistencies across environments.
        - needed more resources to handle operational issues on day to day basis
            - server support
            - patching releases
        - For new-developers it was time taking to provision his development environment in traditional approach.

### VMs vs Containers 
- Each containers has their own libraries, dependencies, image etc.
