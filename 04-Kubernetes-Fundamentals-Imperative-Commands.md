# Kubernetes Architecture

![Kubernetes Architecture](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2475489eaf20163ec0f54ddc1d92aa8d4c87c96b/e7c81/images/docs/components-of-kubernetes.svg)

## Master
### etcd: 
        It is a key-value store, which stores information about the master and the node
### kube-scheduler:
        It is responsible for distributing containers across multiple nodes.
        It watches for newly created pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on
### kube-apiserver: 
        It acts as a fornt-end for Kubernnetes control plane. It exposes the kubernetes API
        CLI tool like kubectl, Users and even Master components (scheduler, controller manager, etcd) and worker-node components like (Kubelet) everything talk with API Server.
### kube Controller Manager: 
        Controllers are responsible for noticing and responding when nodes, containers or endpoints go down.
        They make decisions to bring up new containers in such  cases
### Cloud Control manager:


## Worker Node
### kubelet: 
### kube-Proxy: 

# Kubernetes  - PODs

## Step-01: PODs Introduction
- What is a POD ?
- What is a Multi-Container POD?

## Step-02: PODs Demo
### Get Worker Nodes Status
- Verify if kubernetes worker nodes are ready. 
```
# Get Worker Node Status
kubectl get nodes

# Get Worker Node Status with wide option
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

### Create a Pod
- Create a Pod
```
# Template
kubectl run <desired-pod-name> --image <Container-Image> --generator=run-pod/v1

# Replace Pod Name, Container Image
kubectl run my-first-pod --image stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0 --generator=run-pod/v1
```
- **Important Note:** Without **--generator=run-pod/v1** it will create a pod with a deployment which is another core kubernetes concept which we will learn in next few minutes. 
- **Important Note:**
  - With **Kubernetes 1.18 version**, there is lot clean-up to **kubectl run** command.
  - The below will suffice to create a Pod as a pod without creating deployment. We dont need to add **--generator=run-pod/v1**
```
kubectl run my-first-pod --image stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0
```  

### List Pods
- Get the list of pods
```
# List Pods
kubectl get pods

# Alias name for pods is po
kubectl get po
```

### List Pods with wide option
- List pods with wide option which also provide Node information on which Pod is running
```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

### What happened in the backgroup when above command is run?
  1. Kubernetes created a pod
  2. Pulled the docker image from docker hub
  3. Created the container in the pod
  4. Started the container present in the pod


### Describe Pod
- Describe the POD, primarily required during troubleshooting. 
- Events shown will be of a great help during troubleshooting. 
```
# To get list of pod names
kubectl get pods

# Describe the Pod
kubectl describe pod <Pod-Name>
kubectl describe pod my-first-pod 
```

### Access Application
- Currently we can access this application only inside worker nodes. 
- To access it externally, we need to create a **NodePort Service**. 
- **Services** is one very very important concept in Kubernetes. 


### Delete Pod
```
# To get list of pod names
kubectl get pods

# Delete Pod
kubectl delete pod <Pod-Name>
kubectl delete pod my-first-pod
```

## Step-03: NodePort Service Introduction
- What are Services in k8s?
- What is a NodePort Service?
- How it works?

## Step-04: Demo - Expose Pod with a Service
- Expose pod with a service (NodePort Service) to access the application externally (from internet)
- **Ports**
  - **port:** Port on which node port service listens in Kubernetes cluster internally
  - **targetPort:** We define container port here on which our application is running.
  - **NodePort:** Worker Node port on which we can access our application.
```
# Create  a Pod
kubectl run <desired-pod-name> --image <Container-Image> --generator=run-pod/v1
kubectl run my-first-pod --image stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0 --generator=run-pod/v1

# Expose Pod as a Service
kubectl expose pod <Pod-Name>  --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=<Service-Name>
kubectl expose pod my-first-pod  --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=my-first-service

# Get Service Info
kubectl get service
kubectl get svc

# Get Public IP of Worker Nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```
- **Access the Application using Public IP**
```
http://<node1-public-ip>:<Node-Port>
```

- **Important Note about: target-port**
  -  If target-port is not defined, by default and for convenience, the **targetPort** is set to the same value as the **port** field.

```
# Below command will fail when accessing the application, as service port (81) and container port (80) are different
kubectl expose pod my-first-pod  --type=NodePort --port=81 --name=my-first-service2     

# Expose Pod as a Service with Container Port (--taret-port)
kubectl expose pod my-first-pod  --type=NodePort --port=81 --target-port=80 --name=my-first-service3

# Get Service Info
kubectl get service
kubectl get svc

# Get Public IP of Worker Nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```
- **Access the Application using Public IP**
```
http://<node1-public-ip>:<Node-Port>
```

## Step-05: Interact with a Pod

### Verify Pod Logs
```
# Get Pod Name
kubectl get po

# Dump Pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs my-first-pod

# Stream pod logs with -f option and access application to see logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs -f my-first-pod
```
- **Important Notes**
  - Refer below link and search for **Interacting with running Pods** for additional log options
  - Troubleshooting skills are very important. So please go through all logging options available and master them.
  - **Reference:** https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/

### Connect to Container in a POD
- **Connect to a Container in POD and execute commands**
```
# Connect to Nginx Container in a POD
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod -- /bin/bash

# Execute some commands in Nginx container
ls
cd /usr/share/nginx/html
cat index.html
exit
```

- **Running individual commands in a Container**
```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> env

# Sample Commands
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod env
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod ls
kubectl exec -it my-first-pod cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```
## Step-06: Get YAML Output of Pod & Service
### Get YAML Output
```
# Get pod definition YAML output
kubectl get pod my-first-pod -o yaml   

# Get service definition YAML output
kubectl get service my-first-service -o yaml   
```

## Step-07: Clean-Up
```
# Get all Objects in default namespace
kubectl get all

# Delete Services
kubectl delete svc my-first-service
kubectl delete svc my-first-service2
kubectl delete svc my-first-service3

# Delete Pod
kubectl delete pod my-first-pod

# Get all Objects in default namespace
kubectl get all
```

# Kubernetes - ReplicaSets

## Step-01: Introduction to ReplicaSets
- What are ReplicaSets?
- What is the advantage of using ReplicaSets?

## Step-02: Create ReplicaSet

### Create ReplicaSet
- Create ReplicaSet
```
kubectl create -f replicaset-demo.yml
```
- **replicaset-demo.yml**
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-helloworld-rs
  labels:
    app: my-helloworld
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-helloworld
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-helloworld-app
        image: stacksimplify/kube-helloworld:1.0.0
```

### List ReplicaSets
- Get list of ReplicaSets
```
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl get rs
```

### Describe ReplicaSet
- Describe the newly created ReplicaSet
```
kubectl describe rs/<replicaset-name>

kubectl describe rs/my-helloworld-rs
[or]
kubectl describe rs my-helloworld-rs
```

### List of Pods
- Get list of Pods
```
#Get list of Pods
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Get list of Pods with Pod IP and Node in which it is running
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

### Verify the Owner of the Pod
- Verify the owner reference of the pod.
- Verify under **"name"** tag under **"ownerReferences"**. We will find the replicaset name to which this pod belongs to. 
```
kubectl get pods <pod-name> -o yaml
kubectl get pods my-helloworld-rs-c8rrj -o yaml 
```

## Step-03: Expose ReplicaSet as a Service
- Expose ReplicaSet with a service (NodePort Service) to access the application externally (from internet)
```
# Expose ReplicaSet as a Service
kubectl expose rs <ReplicaSet-Name>  --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=<Service-Name-To-Be-Created>
kubectl expose rs my-helloworld-rs  --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=my-helloworld-rs-service

# Get Service Info
kubectl get service
kubectl get svc

# Get Public IP of Worker Nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```
- **Access the Application using Public IP**
```
http://<node1-public-ip>:<Node-Port>/hello
```

## Step-04: Test Replicaset Reliability or High Availability 
- Test how the high availability or reliability concept is achieved automatically in Kubernetes
- Whenever a POD is accidentally terminated due to some application issue, ReplicaSet should auto-create that Pod to maintain desired number of Replicas configured to achive High Availability.
```
# To get Pod Name
kubectl get pods

# Delete the Pod
kubectl delete pod <Pod-Name>

# Verify the new pod got created automatically
kubectl get pods   (Verify Age and name of new pod)
``` 

## Step-05: Test ReplicaSet Scalability feature 
- Test how scalability is going to seamless & quick
- Update the **replicas** field in **replicaset-demo.yml** from 3 to 6.
```
# Before change
spec:
  replicas: 3

# After change
spec:
  replicas: 6
```
- Update the ReplicaSet
```
# Apply latest changes to ReplicaSet
kubectl replace -f replicaset-demo.yml

# Verify if new pods got created
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## Step-06: Delete ReplicaSet & Service
### Delete ReplicaSet
```
# Delete ReplicaSet
kubectl delete rs <ReplicaSet-Name>

# Sample Commands
kubectl delete rs/my-helloworld-rs
[or]
kubectl delete rs my-helloworld-rs

# Verify if ReplicaSet got deleted
kubectl get rs
```

### Delete Service created for ReplicaSet
```
# Delete Service
kubectl delete svc <service-name>

# Sample Commands
kubectl delete svc my-helloworld-rs-service
[or]
kubectl delete svc/my-helloworld-rs-service

# Verify if Service got deleted
kubectl get svc
```

## Pending Concept in ReplicaSet
- We didn't discuss about **Labels & Selectors**
- This concept we can understand in detail when we are learning to write Kubernetes YAML manifest. 
- So we will understand about this during the **ReplicaSets-YAML** section.
